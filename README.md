IINU React Challenge

This is an ‘onboarding, learning and refreshing yourself with react & testing task' rather than a tech test you can pass or fail sort of situation. Make sure to ask for assistance and clarification on any points and we’ll get back to you ASAP!

Requirements

* Provide a link to public repo on GitHub.

* Test using Jest. * Use Pixabay’s image search API: https://pixabay.com/api/docs/.

* Either provide instructions on how to view your app, or make it live using Heroku or using a similar service.

* Be prepared for discussion and review regardless of completion on 17th November.

Specification

* The user must be able to select the following colours: Red, Yellow, Green and Purple.

* The search must use a random one of the following search terms and the selected colour as a filter: man, mountain, state, ocean, country, building, cat, airline, wealth, happiness, pride, fear, religion, bird, book, phone, rice, snow, water.

* Search example: Red Cat.

* The colours must be presented as squares for the user to select.

* The top 5 search result images returned need to be displayed.

* The top search result needs to be able to be clicked by the user & will take the user to the image’s URL.

Helpful Tips

* Focus on snapshot testing for the React components.

* Any logic used in utility functions or API calls should be unit-tested.

* Mock out the API calls. You can either manually mock the responses or you can try and integrate a 3rd party library such as https://github.com/typicode/json-server.

* The ‘Create React app’ sample is a great place to find boilerplate to quickly get the app running: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.

* There’s no need for persistence be
